            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The objective of Pig Dice Game is to score 100 points before the opponent(s) do(es). The Pig game is played with a single six-sided die.</p>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
              <ul>
                <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
                <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
              </ul>
              The first player to score 100 or more points wins.<br>
              For example, the first player, Anne, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Anne could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Anne rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Anne rolls a 1, and must end her turn without scoring. The next player, Bob, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which he chooses to hold, and adds his turn total of 22 points to his score.</p>
