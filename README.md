## Description
The Pig Dice game is played by 2 players. The first person to start the game rolls the dice repeatedly until the dice rolls to 1. If a 1 is rolled the player loses all the points accumulated in that turn and scores nothing. When this happens, its the second players turn. If the first player rolls another number they can choose to pass the turn/hold and collect all accumulated points in that turn. The rules apply to the second player as well. The first player to score 100 points wins the game.
